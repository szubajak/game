Why functional programming??

Programming languages are becoming more functional every year.
Features such as generic programming, type inference, list comprehensions, functions as values, and anonymous types, which have traditionally existed as staples of functional programming, have quickly become mainstream features of Java, C#, Delphi and even Fortran.
We can expect next-generation programming languages to continue this trend in the future, providing a hybrid of both functional and imperative approaches that meet the evolving needs of modern programming.

Benefits of functional programming:
 - pure functions are easier to reason about
 - testing is easier
 - debugging is easier
 - programs are more bulletproof
 - programs are written at a higher level, and are therefore easier to comprehend
 - function signatures are more meaningful
 - parallel/concurrent programming is easier

“Functional programming is often regarded as the best-kept secret of scientific modelers, mathematicians, artificial intelligence researchers, financial institutions, graphic designers, CPU designers, compiler programmers, and telecommunications engineers.”
